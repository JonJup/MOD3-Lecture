This documents contains literature that was either cited in the MOD3 Lecutre or that I think is helpful to deepen your understanding of the discussed methods. The refernces are arranged in thematic groups following the same structure as the lecture. References within each group are order alphabetically. As some references are pertinent to multiple topics you will find repetitions.
