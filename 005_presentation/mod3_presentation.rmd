# What’s new in multivariate analysis?

# ... or what's old

brainstrom : What Methods do you know? 

--

- PCA
- RDA
- PERMANOVA
- CA/ CCA
- Random Forests 
- Clustering Methods

# Bi/Triplot

```{r load vegan, results='hide', echo = T, message = F}
library(vegan)
data(dune)
data(dune.env)
rda_object <- rda(dune ~ ., dune.env)
```

# Bi/Triplot
```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6, fig.align="center"}
plot(rda_object)
```

---
# What do most ordinations have in common? 

--

They are based on some notion of a distance metric

##fixed 
- PCA and RDA: Euclidean 
- CA and CCA: $\chi^2$-distance

--

##flexible 
- NMDS 
- PCoA
- dbRDA

---
# How does that differ from the univerate and why? 

--

In univariate analyses we mostly use models:
- linear model 
- linear mixed model 
- generalized linear model 
- generalized additive models 

--

$\rightarrow$ why not in multivariate analyses?

# The idea is old 

The Gaussian response model: 
$$Y_i = ce^{- \frac{(X_i - u)^2}{2t^2}} $$
--
Can be rewritten as a GLM:
$$Y_i = exp(ln(c) - \frac{u^2}{2t^2} + \frac{u}{t^2}x_i - \frac{1}{2t^2}x^2_i) = exp(b_1 + b_2 x_i + b_3 x_i^2)$$
--
with 
$$ t = \frac{1}{\sqrt{-2b_3}}; u = \frac{-b_2}{2b_3}; c =     exp(b_1 - \frac{b_2^2}{4b_3})$$ 
--
For M species and Q environmental variables we would need: $(1+2Q)M$ parameters. For 10 species and 5 variables 110 parameters.  

---
# Restricted Gaussian Regression 

gradients as linear combinations of measured variables: 

$$z_i = \Sigma_{p =  1}^Q \alpha_p x_{ip}$$
--
Plug gradients back into Gaussian regression
$$Y_i = ce ^{\frac{(z_i - u)^2}{2t^2}}$$ 

Depending on the number of gradients this reduces the number of parameters. 

---
# What is the model-based approach? 

Model-based approaches assume a parametric generative model

Terms are not consistent:  
Roberts (2019) vs. Warton *el al.* (2012) dissagree about wether CA is distance-based

Alternative: algorithm-based (Warton *et al.* 2015) 
Alternative 2: transformation-based  

"*Our constrained ordination model [...]* " Brittain *et al.* (2020)  
"*Many biologist fit CCA models [...]* " Yee (2004)

# mvabund 

R package published in 2012  (Wang et al. 2012)

**M**ulti**v**ariate **Abund**ance data 

Multivariate
- many, possibly correlated responses 

Abundance
- strong mean variance realtionship

# mvabund uses manyglms 

$$g(\mu_1) ) = L_1 + \epsilon \rightarrow Likelihood\ ratio_1$$
--
$$g(\mu_2) ) = L_2 + \epsilon \rightarrow Likelihood\ ratio_2$$

--
The individual Likelihood ratios indicate the effect on a single species. 

The sum $\Sigma LR$ that on the community.
